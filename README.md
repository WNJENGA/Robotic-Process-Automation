# Robotic-Process-Automation
# Customer Care Job Card Creation Bot

## Requirements:
- UiPath Studio and Robot Agent connected to your machine and a Chrome UiPath Extention Enabled
- Microsoft Excel (Office)
- Windows 7 or higher
- Any SaaS based ticketing system - I'm using Zoho for this one - already logged in on chrome (or whatever browser so long as you have the necessary plugins specific to that browser installed as well).
- Run the Main file in UiPath studio.

## How it works
- A UiPath based Robot Agent will trigger the automated bot with Hotkey keyboard trigger/shortcuts (ALT +S).
- The bot will then open and read the Request.xlsx excel sheets from the 'Requests' folder,The excel file has the customer details and request.
- The details obtaine from the excel doc will be used to automatially create a job card (a ticket) in Zoho desk website application.
- Once the ticket is created, the request file file will be moved to the 'Processed' folder.
- The Robot agent can place another 'request.xlsx' file in the Request folder and use 'ALT +S' to create another jobcard
- The customare care assistant has to use the 'STOP' option in the UiPath Studio to stop the automation.
